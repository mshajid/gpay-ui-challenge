## Description

This UI challenge gave me a confident on using Vite and Tailwind CSS also including building and deployment made easy for me without any errors at first. All thanks to **Akalya** - https://github.com/MUTHUAKALYA for all the sketches and wire frames of the app. Because we didn't have the app in our country to understand the UI.
